You are tasked with building the program that will allow the teacher to do this easily.\n","\n","#The program will prompt the teacher to enter the grades of each student. Once the teacher has entered all the grades, the program will calculate the total sum of the grades and display it on the screen. Then, the program will create a new list by selecting only the grades of the first, third, and fifth students entered by the teacher, and sort them in ascending order.\n","\n","#Finally, the program will print out the new list, along with its length and the number of occurrences of the score 5 in the list. This will give the teacher a good overview of the performance of the selected students, and help them identify any potential issues early on.\n","\n","#Hint:\n","\n","#You can use the input() function to ask the user to enter their information.\n","\n","#Look for list methods to perform the tasks.\n","\n","#Remember, it is possible to get a part of the sequence using:\n","\n","#sequence[x:y:z]\n","#where x, y, z are integers.\n","\n","#The above returns a new sequence with the following characteristics:\n","\n","#A sequence with the same type as the original (a slice of a list is a list, a slice of a tuple is a tuple, and a slice of a string is a string).\n","#A sequence with elements from sequence [x] to sequence [y-1] (does not include a sequence [y]).
